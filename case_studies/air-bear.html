                <h5>Description</h5>
                        <p>Air Bear is a smart air quality monitor for children that notifies parents of harmful air
                            quality, uses AI to nudge positive behavioural changes and prompts climate action. It was
                            designed under the brief "Apply AI" for the 2023/24 RSA Design Awards.</p>

                <h5>Problem</h5>
                <p>Children are highly vulnerable to poor air quality related heath issues. Parents often overlook
                    air quality's impact on children's health, risking future problems such as asthma, hay fever and
                    cancer.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h5>Proposal</h5>
                <p>
                    Air Bear uses a network of bears collecting air particle data to create a comprehension of air
                    quality around children in a localised area. The app prompts community engagements and
                    participation through the use of community groups
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The Air Bear App notifies parents of predicted harmful air scenarios, recommending tailored
                    behavioural changes to protect their child.

                <h5>Research</h5>
                <p>From interviews with parents and guardians who have participated in climate activism to improve air
                    quality issues in their area, I gained insight into the need for accessible predictive, current, and
                    past air quality data to inform parent's decisions around children's exposure to air pollutants.
                    <br><br>
                    Through co-design and feedback sessions, the necessity to nudge parents and others to participate in
                    a collective effort to improve air quality in any manner was apparent.

                <h5>Concepting</h5>
                <p>
                    During the concept phase, ideas were generated through ideation sessions with parents using 'How
                    Might We' statements. Sticky-note brainstorming and Crazy Eights sessions were conducted in support
                    of the idea generation.

            <h5>Prototyping</h5>
            <div class="flex-row-start">
                <p>3 physical teddy bear prototypes were created for testing to evaluate the functionality of the
                    electronics (air quality sensors), and to establish how children would react and interact with the
                    teddy bears as Air Bear's intent was to fit into children's daily routine seamlessly.</p>

        <section id="evaluation-section" class="hideme">
            <h5>Evaluation</h5>
            <video src="../videos/air-bear-prototype-vid.mp4" autoplay muted loop></video>
            <div class="flex-row-start">
                <p>Observations from cultural probes established that children had no issue with the teddy bears being
                    part of their routines, validating the idea.
                    <br><br>
                    Parent's expressed the opinion that it would not grab their child's attention and would possibly not
                    be played with. This was a non-issue as there would be less interference with the internal
                    electronics and therefore less outlying air quality data.
                </p>
                <p>The Air Bear app was observably usable, and parents had no issue understanding the navigation through
                    the app.
                    <br><br>
                    Feedback on a visual redesign was received. Given testing was conducted with a first-iteration
                    high-fidelity prototype, this was foreseeable.
